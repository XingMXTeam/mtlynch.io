## Overview

This document explains processes and conventions I use when working with freelance developers.

If you're reading this document before working with me, feel free to skim it quickly to see if this working style matches yours. If you're reading it while on an active contract with me, read it thoroughly and bill me for the time.

## Golden rule

I want to treat you how I'd like to be treated.

## Communication

I value effective communication higher than everything else. Err on the side of overcommunication.

I appreciate hearing why you chose a particular solution and the other avenues you've explored.

### Email

I communicate primarily over email.

### Resolve emails quickly

I write emails in a style Cal Newport describes as [“process-centric.”](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/04/19/write-longer-emails/)

Emails usually represent a task or a question, and we're aiming to resolve it with as few back-and-forths as possible.

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Bad Email Sequence</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Good Email Sequence</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Freelancer</strong>: What format do you prefer for the image? PNG or JPEG?
<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: PNG
   </td>
   <td rowspan="3" ><strong>Freelancer</strong>: I'd love your input on the image. Can you let me know your preferences on the following?
<ul>

<li>Format (PNG or JPEG)?

<li>Size (in pixels)?

<li>Should it rescale on smaller devices?

<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: Thanks for the well-thought out questions!
<ul>

<li>The format should be PNG.

<li>The size should be 800x600px on desktop and 400x300px on viewports smaller than 768px.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Freelancer</strong>: What size should it be?
<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: 800x600px
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Freelancer</strong>: Should it rescale on smaller devices?
<p>
<strong>Me</strong>: Yes, it should be 400x300px on viewports smaller than 768px.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

### Email response time

If we're in the middle of ongoing work, I expect responses to emails within one business day. In other words, if I email you at 3pm on a Tuesday, I expect a response back by 3pm Wednesday.

If you don't have a complete answer, respond to acknowledge the message and provide an ETA of when I should expect a complete response. It's okay if turnaround time is occasionally longer than one working day, but it should be the exception and not the norm. You can expect the same from me.

### Meetings

I use meetings to discuss topics that require low-latency back-and-forths. I use emails to discuss facts. Avoid scheduling a meeting to ask questions that could have been an email.

* **Bad Meeting Discussions**
  * Can we schedule a meeting to discuss the deadline for this project?
    * BAD: We can figure that out over email.
* **Good Meeting Discussions**
  * I've read section X of the spec, but I'm still confused. Can we meet to discuss it?
    * GOOD: This will require a back and forth that would take too many emails.

## Interviews

I never conduct formal interviews in deciding whether to hire someone.

I'll ask to see examples of previous work, or I may ask a few questions over email, but I'm most interested in how well we work together. If you're a good candidate, I try to set up a narrowly scoped job where I pay you your normal rate.

If I ask you to begin a paid trial assignment, I'll pay you for your time even if we decide not to work together afterwards. The only exception is if you fail to make a good-faith effort on the assignment (e.g., you bill five hours on a programming task and deliver zero code).

## Due Diligence

Freelancers provide the most value when they minimize the time I spend on tasks I've delegated to them. Critical to this goal is performing due diligence before reaching out to me with questions.

Due diligence usually means searching for answers online, but it can also mean taking a closer look at documents I've provided.

I want you to feel comfortable asking questions, but I also expect you to answer questions on your own where possible. If you're unable to answer the question, let me know how you've tried to solve the problem.

* **Bad Questions**
  * How do I install Flask on my computer?
  * Who's Elon Musk?
  * How do I link to specific sections of a Google Doc?

* **Good Questions**
  * I'm having trouble understanding section 3 of the spec. Does "bat" refer to sports equipment or the animal?
  * When I try to install your software, I get the error message <code>FooBarBaz</code>. I've re-read the installation guide and searched the open issues, but I can't figure out what's going wrong. Do you know what the problem is?

## Availability

I don't expect anyone to be available more than five days per week. Unless you tell me otherwise, I'll assume you don't work on weekends. If there are other days you don't work, let me know. Working fewer than five days per week is fine as long as I know the schedule in advance.

I don't work weekends or major US holidays. You're welcome to email me on the weekend, but I won't respond until the next business day. I try to avoid email before noon in US Eastern Time.

You're free to work whichever hours you like, but I'd like you to have at least some overlap with my working hours, which are 10am-6:30pm ET.

## Feedback

It's common for me to ask for feedback during or after a project. I do this because I think freelancers often have useful ideas for improving processes or work dynamics, but they don't feel comfortable sharing until they're asked directly.

My questions are generally:

*   Are there things I can improve to make the work smoother or more enjoyable?
*   Are there types of work you want to do more of? Less of?

## Deadlines

It's rare that I need work urgently, so I generally allow you to set your deadlines. That said, you're responsible for meeting your deadlines and managing expectations when there are delays.

Don't allow deadlines to sail by without an update. If you tell me to expect work by 5 PM ET Tuesday, and I don't see anything from you by Tuesday night, it creates stress for me because I don't know if you've completely forgotten the task or you're running slightly late.

If you're going to miss a deadline, let me know, at the latest, by the deadline. The earlier you can let me know about a deadline slip, the better. In general, delays are not a big deal as long as I can plan around them. If a deadline is important to me, I'll let you know.

When specifying deadlines, use precise, unambiguous time conventions:

*   **Pretty Good**: I'll send it to you by EOD Friday
*   **Better**: I'll send it to you by 5pm ET on Dec. 8th.
*   **Bad**: I'll have it ready in the next few days.
    *   Too vague.
*   **Terrible**: I'll let you know when it's ready.
    *   Extremely vague

## Timeboxing

Early in our work together, I'll ask you to respect a limit on billable hours per project. I do this to control billing as I get a sense of how long tasks take you and whether we work well together. As we work together more, I'll increase or eliminate this limit to give you more autonomy.

If you won't be able to complete a task within the hours limit, let me know as soon as possible. If you're approaching the end of the hours limit and won't finish, reserve time to organize what you have and present it with an explanation of what's complete and what's incomplete.

I will not pay for any work performed beyond the agreed hourly limit.

## Documentation

I value documentation highly.

If a project has documented processes or Github templates, please follow them. If the documentation tells you to do something that seems incorrect, let me know. Please don't ignore documentation assuming that it's out of date or not meant for you.

If you had to figure something out to ramp up on a project or a component, please document the process you learned and submit it to me.

Document the code that you write. You don't have to write comments or READMEs for every little thing. Aim to document new code to roughly the same degree as nearby existing code.

## Code quality

I value code quality and maintainability over speed. Once you have working code, take a second pass to see if you can simplify it or refactor the logic to make it more intuitive.

If it takes you twice as long to make your code 30% simpler, I view that as time well-spent.

## Code reviews

I expect you to submit pull requests following the conventions in [“How to Make Your Code Reviewer Fall in Love with You.”](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/)

I will review your code following conventions from [“How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human.”](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)

I likely give more code review feedback than most clients who hire freelance developers. My comments are not meant to criticize you or make you feel bad but rather to help me understand the code and get it to a state where I feel comfortable maintaining it long-term.

## Code style

I follow Google's style guides:

*   [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
*   [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
*   [JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
*   [Shell](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

As much as possible, I [use automated tools to enforce style conventions](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#let-computers-do-the-boring-parts).

## Testing

If there are automated tests or CI checks, you're responsible for keeping them green. You should fix all breaks before sending me code to review.

If you've added a feature that changes behavior, you're responsible for adding tests to exercise the new behavior and updating any previous tests to match the new behavior.

If it's a feature that's difficult to test with automation, you should run manual tests to exercise the new code. If you can't find a way to do that, warn me that it's untested when you send it for review (this should be extremely rare).

## Git

If you need to sync changes from the `master` branch into yours (e.g., if other changes occurred while you were working on a pull request), **[rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)** from `master`.

Never merge from `master`, as that pulls unrelated changes into your pull request and makes it difficult to review.

## Billable hours

I consider almost everything you do in service of working with me to be billable work.

* **Examples of non-billable work**
  * Reading a book cover-to-cover because it's related to your work
    * Reading a chapter is fine.
  * Fixing your work computer because your hard drive died
  * Shopping for a new desk chair
* **Examples of billable work**
  * Communicating with me (including emails, video calls, and in-person meetings)
  * Reading documents I ask you to read (including this one)
  * Researching a technique or technology relevant to your work
  * Going for a walk to think about a difficult problem

## Expenses

I'll pay for the cost of any software, services, or equipment you need to purchase to work on my projects, as long as you run it by me first.

I expect you to provide the basic tools you need to operate as a freelance developer (e.g., computer, internet connection, electricity), but I'll cover the cost of expenses that are specific to my project.

## Monitoring

I trust you to report your hours honestly. I will never ask you to "prove" your hours to me or install any software on your system that monitors your work.

If we're on a platform such as Upwork where monitoring is built-in, I will always make this optional, and I won't review the logs unless there's an egregious discrepancy in hours. Even in that case, I'll speak to you before reviewing logs.

## Payment

You can expect payment within five business days of job or milestone completion, usually sooner. If we are working together regularly, I'll ask you to send me invoices every two weeks.

I don't give bonuses or tips. I want the rate to be as transparent as possible in compensation.

I pay via PayPal, ACH transfer, or a mailed check.

## Post-contract work

It's my responsibility to determine that you delivered everything and implemented everything before payment time.

I'll never contact you after a job and ask you questions about your work or ask you to make changes for free.

If I discover an issue in your work after I send you payment, I am responsible for fixing it or paying you for a new job.

## Credit

Assume you won't be publicly credited on the project unless we specifically negotiate that as part of the contract. Depending on the project, I may publicly credit your work and link to your website, but I will ask your permission first.

## Taxes

If I pay you more than $600 per calendar year, I need some forms for tax purposes.

### US citizens / residents

I'll need you to provide me with a [W-9 form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf). At the end of the year, I'll provide you with a 1099-MISC.

### Non-US freelancers

If you're not a US citizen, I'll need a [W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) form.
