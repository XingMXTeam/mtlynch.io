## Meta

This is the document I show to all freelance developers when I offer them a job. It is based on my experience hiring and working with developers and other freelancers over the past six years.

## Overview

This document explains processes and conventions I use when working with freelance developers.

If you're reading this document before working with me, feel free to skim it quickly to see if this working style matches yours. If you're reading it while on an active contract with me, read it thoroughly and bill me for the time.

## Golden rule

I want to treat you how I'd like to be treated.

## Communication

I value effective communication higher than everything else. Err on the side of overcommunication.

I appreciate hearing why you chose a particular solution and the other avenues you've explored.

### Resolve emails quickly

I primarily communicate over email. I write emails in a style Cal Newport describes as ["process-centric."](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2016/04/19/write-longer-emails/)

Emails usually represent a task or a question, and we're aiming to resolve it with as few back-and-forths as possible.

* **Bad Email Sequence**
  * **Freelancer**: What format do you prefer for the image? PNG or JPEG?
  * **Me**: PNG
  * **Freelancer**: What size should it be?
  * **Me**: 800x600px
  * **Freelancer**: Should it rescale on smaller devices?
  * **Me**: Yes, it should be 400x300px on viewports smaller than 768px.
* **Good Email Sequence**
   * **Freelancer**: I'd love your input on the image. Can you let me know your preferences on the following?
      * Format (PNG or JPEG)?
      * Size (in pixels)?
      * Should it rescale on smaller devices?
  * **Me**: Thanks for the well-thought out questions!
    * The format should be PNG.
    * The size should be 800x600px on desktop and 400x300px on viewports smaller than 768px.

### Email response time

If we're in the middle of ongoing work, I expect responses to emails within one business day. In other words, if I email you at 3pm on a Tuesday, I expect a response back by 3pm Wednesday.

If you don't have a complete answer, respond to acknowledge the message and provide an ETA of when I should expect a complete response.

It's okay if turnaround time is occasionally longer than one working day, but it should be the exception and not the norm. You can expect the same from me.

### Meetings

I use meetings to discuss topics that require low-latency back-and-forths. If we begin working together long-term, I'll schedule meetings about once per month to check in. I've found that this is good for the social aspects of working together. I use emails for everything else. Avoid scheduling a meeting to ask questions that could have been an email.

* **Bad Meeting Discussions**
  * Can we schedule a meeting to discuss the deadline for this project?
    * BAD: We can figure that out over email.
* **Good Meeting Discussions**
  * I've read section X of the spec, but I'm still confused. Can we meet to discuss it?
    * GOOD: This will require a back and forth that would take too many emails.

## Interviews

I never conduct formal interviews in deciding whether to hire someone.

I'll ask to see examples of previous work, or I may ask a few questions over email, but I'm most interested in how well we work together. If you're a good candidate, I try to set up a narrowly scoped job at your normal rate.

If I ask you to begin a paid trial assignment, I'll pay for your time even if we decide not to work together afterwards. The only exception is if you fail to make a good-faith effort on the assignment (e.g., you bill five hours on a programming task and deliver zero code).

## Due Diligence

Freelancers provide the most value when they minimize the time I spend on tasks I've delegated to them. Critical to this goal is performing due diligence before reaching out to me with questions.

I want you to feel comfortable asking questions, but I also expect you to answer questions on your own where possible. If you're unable to answer the question, let me know how you've tried to solve the problem.

* **Bad Questions**
  * How do I install Flask on my computer?
  * Who's Elon Musk?
  * How do I link to specific sections of a Google Doc?

* **Good Questions**
  * I'm having trouble understanding section 3 of the spec. Does "bat" refer to sports equipment or the animal?
  * When I try to install your software, I get the error message <code>FooBarBaz</code>. I've re-read the installation guide and searched the open issues, but I can't figure out what's going wrong. Do you know what the problem is?

## Availability

I don't expect anyone to be available more than five days per week. Unless you tell me otherwise, I'll assume you don't work on weekends. If there are other days you don't work, let me know. Working fewer than five days per week is fine as long as I know the schedule in advance.

I don't work weekends or major US holidays. You're welcome to email me on the weekend, but I won't respond until the next business day. I try to avoid email before noon in US Eastern Time.

You're free to work whichever hours you like, but I'd like you to have at least some overlap with my working hours, which are 10am-6:30pm ET.

## Feedback

It's common for me to ask for feedback during or after a project. I do this because I think freelancers often have useful ideas for improving processes or work dynamics, but they don't feel comfortable sharing until they're asked directly.

My questions are generally:

*   Are there things I can improve to make the work smoother or more enjoyable?
*   Are there types of work you want to do more of? Less of?

## Deadlines

It's rare that I need work urgently, so I generally allow you to set your deadlines. That said, you're responsible for meeting your deadlines and managing expectations when there are delays.

Don't allow deadlines to sail by without an update. If you tell me to expect work by 5 PM ET Tuesday, and I don't see anything from you by Tuesday night, it creates stress for me because I don't know if you've completely forgotten the task or you're running slightly late.

If you're going to miss a deadline, let me know. The earlier you can let me know about a deadline slip, the better. The absolute latest you should be telling me about a delay is at the time of the deadline itself. In general, delays are not a big deal as long as I can plan around them. If a deadline is important to me, I'll let you know.

When specifying deadlines, use precise, unambiguous time conventions:

* <font color="green"> **Pretty Good** </font>: I'll send it to you by EOD Friday
* <font color="green"> **Better** </font>: I'll send it to you by 5pm ET on Dec. 8th.
* <font color="red"> **Bad** </font>: I'll have it ready in the next few days.
  * Too vague.
* <font color="red"> **Terrible** </font>: I'll let you know when it's ready.
  * Extremely vague

## Timeboxing

Early in our work together, I'll ask you to respect a limit on billable hours per project. I do this to control billing as I get a sense of how long tasks take you and whether we work well together. As we work together more, I'll increase or eliminate this limit to give you more autonomy.

If you're approaching the end of the hours limit and won't finish, reserve time to organize what you have and present it with an explanation of what's complete and what's incomplete.

I will not pay for any work performed beyond the agreed hours cap.

## Documentation

I value documentation highly.

If a project has documented processes or Github templates, please follow them. If the documentation tells you to do something that seems incorrect, let me know. Don't assume that instructions are out of date or not meant for you.

When you begin working with me on a project, you become the new owner of its ramp-up documents. If you had to figure something out that wasn't documented, please submit edits to fill the gaps.

Thoughtfully document the code that you write. Aim to make the code self-documenting, but include source comments for things you can't express in code. Aim to document new code to roughly the same degree as nearby existing code.

```python
# Number of days per week (7)   <-- BAD comment
DAYS_PER_WEEK = 7

# This is a workaround for a bug in FooComponent, which crashes the process
# if we call it immediately after writing to disk. <-- GOOD comment
time.sleep(5)
```

## Code quality

I value quality and maintainability over turnaround time. Once you have working code, take a second pass to see if you can simplify it or refactor the logic to make it more intuitive.

If it takes you twice as long to make your code 30% simpler, that's a net positive for me.

## Code reviews

I likely give more code review feedback than most freelance clients. My comments are not meant to criticize you or make you feel bad. I review rigorously to help me understand the code and get it to a state where I feel comfortable maintaining it long-term.

These articles explain my code review process:

* [How you should submit code for review](https://mtlynch.io/code-review-love/)
* [How I review code](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/)

## Code style

My projects adhere to Google's code style guidelines:

*   [Python](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
*   [HTML/CSS](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html)
*   [JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html)
*   [Shell](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)

As much as possible, I [use automated tools to enforce style conventions](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/#let-computers-do-the-boring-parts).

## Git

I use Git for source control.

I merge changes through GitHub pull requests + squash and merge. You don't need to maintain a beautiful commit history within your pull requests because I'm going to collapse them all down to a single commit before merging.

Write sensible pull requests. ["How to Write a Git Commit Message"](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) is a good explanation, but I only care about the pull request message. You can

* Don't squash a commit after you've pushed it (especially after I've reviewed it).
* If you need new changes from the `master` branch, rebase from master, never *merge*.

I assign repo access on a least-privilege basis. If you're working on a public repository, you don't need special access. You can clone the repo and begin making pull requests.

You generally won't have to do anything complicated. The most complicated thing I'll ask you to do is rebase.

If you need to sync changes from the `master` branch into yours (e.g., if other changes occurred while you were working on a pull request), **[rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing)** from `master`.

Never merge from `master`, as that pulls unrelated changes into your pull request and makes it difficult to review.

## Testing

If there are automated tests or CI checks, you're responsible for keeping them green. Fix any build breaks before sending me code to review.

If you've added a feature that changes behavior, you're responsible for adding tests to exercise the new behavior and updating any previous tests.

If it's a feature that's difficult to test with automation, you should run manual tests to exercise the new code. If you can't find a way to do that, warn me that it's untested when you send it for review (this should be extremely rare).

## Billable hours

I consider almost everything you do in service of working with me to be billable work.

* **Examples of billable work**
  * Communicating with me (including emails, video calls, and in-person meetings)
  * Reading documents I ask you to read (including this one)
  * Researching a technique or technology relevant to your work
  * Going for a walk to think about a difficult problem

* **Examples of non-billable work**
  * Reading a book cover-to-cover because it's related to your work
    * Reading a chapter is fine.
  * Fixing your work computer because your hard drive died
  * Shopping for a new desk chair

## Expenses

I'll pay for the cost of any software, services, or equipment you need to purchase to work on my projects, as long as you run it by me first.

I expect you to provide the basic tools you need to operate as a freelance developer (e.g., computer, internet connection, electricity), but I'll cover the cost of expenses that are specific to my project.

## Monitoring

I trust you to report your hours honestly. I'll never ask you to "prove" your hours to me or install any surveillance software on your system.

If we're on a platform such as Upwork where monitoring is built-in, I'll always make the monitoring features optional. I won't review the logs unless there's an egregious discrepancy in hours. Even in that case, I'll speak to you before reviewing logs.

## Payment

Please send me invoices for your hours every two weeks. You can expect payment within five business days of the invoice, usually sooner.

I don't give bonuses or tips. I want your compensation to be as transparent as possible.

I pay via PayPal, Payoneer, ACH transfer, or a mailed check.

## Post-contract work

I'll never contact you after a job and ask you questions about your work or ask you to make changes for free. It's my responsibility to determine that you delivered everything I requested within the time we work together under contract.

If I discover an issue in your work after I send you payment, I am responsible for fixing it myself or offering you additional billable hours.

## Taxes

If I pay you more than $600 per calendar year, I need some forms for tax purposes.

### US citizens and residents

You'll need to provide a [W-9 form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf). At the end of the year, I'll send you a [1099-MISC](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-1099-misc).

### Non-US freelancers

I'll need a [W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) form that declares you don't owe US taxes.

## Intellectual property

If we're working together on a project where I want to retain intellectual property rights, I'll send you a contract to e-sign that declares that in exchange for your hourly rate, I am purchasing the rights to the code you write for me. The contract is specifically about work you produce for me, not all code you write.
