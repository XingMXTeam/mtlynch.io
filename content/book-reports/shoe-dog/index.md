I was hoping this would contain more business lessons, but it's more like a fun business-themed story.

## What I Liked

* It's funny
  * I laughed out loud several times while reading it, which is rare for me while reading.
* I related strongly to the experience of [struggling with overseas suppliers](/retrospectives/2021/03/#dealing-with-materials-shortage).
* As a casual runner, it was motivating to read someone write about running with such love and celebration.

## What I Disliked

* I felt bad for his employees.
  * It seemed like they worked so much harder and sacrificed more for Nike than he did, yet he kept most of the rewards.
  * Knight deliberately withheld praise and encouragement, even when they outright begged him for approval.
* A lot of the Asian characters seemed more like caricatures who spoke in broken English.
  * In fairness, almost all of the people in the book feel like their personalities are embellished to cartoonish proportions.
* The cutesy romantic way he meets his wife would today be egregious sexual harassment.
* He built a lot of his business by lying to partners and employees.

## Key Takeaways

### Origins

* Knight was a runner in high school and college.
  * In college, he trained under Bill Bowerman (TODO: link), one of the most respected running coaches in the world.
* Knight originally started Nike under the name Blue Ribbon shoes.
  * Blue Ribbon formed as the US distributor for a Japanese shoe company called Onitsuka.
  * Knight lied to Onitsuka, telling them that Blue Ribbon was an existing, successful company. In reality, he formed the company specifically to import their shoes.
  * At the time (1963), Adidas and Puma dominated the US shoe market. Japan was just beginning to reach maturity in manufacturing capabilities, and they were producing sneakers at high quality for low cost.

* Knight partnered with Bowerman after the first shoe samples arrived from Japan.
  * They formed a 51/49 partnership, with Knight as the majority owner.

* Knight failed to sell Onitsuka shoes to sporting goods stores, but he successfully sold shoes by attending track meets and selling to runners directly.

### Management without praise

* Knight's stinginess with praise is a recurring theme in the book.
  * At several points, his employees are struggling with morale and beg him for encouragement, but he ignores them.
  * He believes he learned this behavior from his father and from Bill Bowerman, who he saw as a father figure. Both men gave praise sparingly.
  * Knight believed that this inspired people to work harder.

### Growth outpacing equity

* Throughtout the company's history, Knight would keep nearly zero equity.
  * As soon as he sold a batch of imported sneakers, he'd use 100% of his cash to buy more inventory.
* Knight took bank loans to cover costs, but banks were always dissatisfied with his equity.
  * Banks felt that his equity was too low relative to his growth and that he should be holding more cash.
* Venture capital wasn't prevalent in the 1960s.
  * In the 70s, Knight sought VC funding for his sneaker company, but VCs were primarily interested in high-tech companies, so they found the sneaker business unappealing.
* To earn cash for the business, Knight took a full-time job as an accountant.
  * Through his job, he audited companies and found that insufficient equity was one of the most common reasons for a company to fall into bankruptcy.

### Penny Knight

* Knight met his wife Penny because she was his student when he was teaching at Portland State University.
  * He had a crush on her, so he offered her a job at his company.
  * After she started working for him, he asked her out and they began dating.

This is a weird dynamic, as Knight held power over Penny in so many dimensions. At the time they began dating, he was her professor, advisor, and employer.
